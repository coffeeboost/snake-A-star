# snake game with A* agent

This project was for COMP3106 with Professor Holden. Credits to [python-engineer](https://github.com/python-engineer/snake-ai-pytorch) for the template snake game logic.

- The agent works by computing the shortest path to a food source. 
- The trick when no path is found is to take the last searched grid. 
- A* search works by taking the best node considering path cost and heuristic.
- The heuristic used was Manhattan distance.
- Best score achieved by the agent was 100. Best score I achieved was 20.
